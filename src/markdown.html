<p>Whether or not a keyword is required is indicated in the description.</p>

<p>This command must be executed twice in order to obtain the disaggregated series
unless there are no high frequency indicator variables.  (This is necessary
because high and low frequency series cannot exist in the same dataset.)
The first time the low frequency dataset must be active, and the <strong>LOWFREQ</strong> keyword
must be supplied.  The command is followed by DATASET ACTIVE to make the
high frequency series dataset active, and STATS DISAGG is executed again
to fetch these variables.  The disaggregated series is written to a new dataset.</p>

<p>All keywords can be specified on either pass except that LOWFREQ must
be given on the first pass.</p>

<p><strong>LOWFREQ</strong> (required on first pass) specifies the series to be disaggregated.</p>

<p><strong>HIGHFREQ</strong> (optional) specifies one or more indicator series to
be used in disaggregating the low frequency series.  If HIGHFREQ
is not used, the disaggregated series will be constant within the
time points for each particular low frequency time point.</p>

<p><strong>LOWFREQSTART</strong> and <strong>HIGHFREQSTART</strong> (required) specify the starting
time of the low frequency series and, if <strong>HIGHFREQ</strong> is used, the
high frequency series.  The value can be a single number such
as a year, or it can be two numbers such a year and month.
The second value is assumed to be 1 if omitted.
If the data are not time series, use starting values of 1.</p>

<p><strong>FREQUENCY</strong> specifies the frequency ratio of the low frequency
series and the disaggregated series.  For example, to disaggregate
quarterly data to monthly, the value would be 3.  The value must
be an integer.</p>

<p><strong>USEHIGHFREQ</strong> = NO can be specified if there will be no
high frequency indicators.  If specified, the disaggregation
occurs on a single pass.</p>

<p>This command expects to take two passes (unless USEHIGHFREQ=NO).
Therefore, it saves information from the first pass and expects
a second pass to follow.  If the first pass is run but the
procedure needs to start over with a new first pass, specify
<strong>FIRSTPASS</strong>=YES to cause the saved information to be discarded.</p>

<h2>OPTIONS</h2>

<p>The OPTIONS subcommand specifies how the disaggregation is
to be done.</p>

<p><strong>CONVERSIONTYPE</strong> (optional) specifies the relationship of the 
disaggregated values to the original.  <strong>SUM</strong> and <strong>AVERAGE</strong> specify
that the sum or average of the entire disaggregated series equals
the corresponding statistic for the low frequency series.
<strong>FIRST</strong> and <strong>LAST</strong> specify that the first or last value of
the disaggregated series equals the corresponding value
of the low frequency series.</p>

<p><strong>CONVERSIONMETHOD</strong> (optional) specifies the conversion algorithm.  The
Chow-Lin, Litterman, and Fernandez methods (with variations)
use generalized least squares of the low frequency variable
on the aggregated values of the high frequency series and
then distribute the differences in the result across the
quarterly values.  The estimated relationship between the
low frequency series (actual and aggregated) is assumed to
hold also for the high frequency series.  The GLS estimators
include estimation of an autoregression parameter, rho. 
The OLS method does ordinary least squares (with no
autocorrelation parameter).  These methods all require at 
least one high frequency indicator.</p>

<p>The remaining methods (Denton type) can be used with or without
an indicator variable and  minimize the sum of squared
deviations of the low and high frequency series using
two additional parameters.  Only one indicator variable
is allowed.</p>

<p>For details on these algorithms, see
<a href="http://journal.r-project.org/archive/2013-2/sax-steiner.pdf">http://journal.r-project.org/archive/2013-2/sax-steiner.pdf</a></p>

<p><strong>MINRHO</strong> (optional) specifies the minimum value of the
autocorrelation parameter and defaults to 0. Applies to
GLS methods only.</p>

<p><strong>DIFFDEGREE</strong> (optional) can be 0, 1, or 2 to determine whether
Denton methods use levels, first difference, or 
second difference in the minimization.</p>

<p><strong>DENTONCRIT</strong> (optional) specifies whether Denton methods use
proportional or absolute deviations in the minimization.</p>

<h2>OUTPUT</h2>

<p>The OUTPUT subcommand specifies the desired output.</p>

<p><strong>OUTPUTDS</strong> (required) specifies a name for the output
dataset.  The dataset will contain the disaggregated series
and a time variable.  The dataset name must not already be
in use.  Period 1 in the time variable has value 0
even though the starting values count from 1.  For example,
a starting value of 2000 1 produces a first time value of
2000.00.</p>

<p><strong>PLOT</strong> specifies whether or not to plot the actual and fitted
low frequency values and residuals.</p>
